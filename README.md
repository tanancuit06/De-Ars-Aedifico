# **De Ars Aedifico**

De Ars Aedifico is a set of software tools to perform structural analysis and design according to the user's needs.

## Objectives

It is intended to the following:

1. To give civil engineers a powerfool toolset that can perform complex strucutral analyses in the simplest way possible and the most accurate results.
2. To create a free open source toolset that can be used as an aid to structural engineers without having to buy a expensive license. 

## Development Requirements and Procedures

### Requirements

1. To be a progressive and modular software that can accomodate new features without breaking existing essential ones.
2. To use the best coding practices to achieve a clean code and aimed to opimitization in the numerical analyses.
3. To make full use of free open source libraries and tools and offer a new FOSS product.
4. Aimed to be used primarely by using a GUI but also with the possibility to work with scripts.

### Procedures

1. The scripts are going to initially developed by using Python 3.0 in order to get working features delivered at a fast pace and will serve as prototypes of the optimized rewritten scripts in C++.
2. It will use procedural and object oriented paradigms.

## License

Please refer to LICENSE file. The license may be changed later but will be focused to keep the program as FOSS.
